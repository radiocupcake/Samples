    <h1>Britney's Website Building Cheat Sheet</h1>
    <p class="subtitle">A step-by-step guide to build a basic webpage using HTML and CSS.</p>
    <h2>Step 1</h2>
    <div class="row">
        <div class="column">
            <p>The first thing you should always do is get your folders and files created and organized. To do this, create a folder in a designated spot of your choosing. Pick an easy-to-remember folder name that will make the project easily identifiable by you. Somewhere within that folder, you'll need to have one HTML document to write your HTML code in, and one CSS document to style your HTML using CSS code. You can create these in your text editor or IDE by opening the folder and adding a file. The HTML file name must end with .html and likewise the CSS file must end with .css. Once you have your folders organized to your preferences, and you've created an HTML and CSS file, you can move on to the next step.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="column">
            <figure>
                <img src="img1.png" alt="img1">
                <figcaption>This is my text editor during the creation of this page. To the left you can see my folder and files.</figcaption>
            </figure>
        </div>
    </div>    
    <h2>Step 2</h2>
    <p>Now you need to open your HTML file and start adding some code. You'll need to put your HTML declaration first. Then the opening and closing declaration tags. Within that you should have your opening and closing head tags, followed by opening and closing body tags. The head tags should contain your metadata, your title, and this is also where you'll link your CSS file. You can find most of this code on the Codecademy website and copy and paste it. Then move on to step 3.</p>
    <h2>Step 3</h2>
    <p>Now that your header is complete, you can start working on the body. This will be made up of a variety of tags, some of which I have outlined in the table below. These tags will contain all of your websites content such as text, images, and tables. Once you've done that, begin step 4.</p>
    <table>
        <thead>
            <tr>
                <th>Tag</th>
                <th>Content</th>
                <th>Format</th>
                <th>Required Attributes</th>
            </tr>
        </thead>
        <tbody>
            <tr>
                <td>h1-h6</td>
                <td>headings</td>

                <td>a table</td>
                <td>opening and closing tags with table rows, table headings & table data contained</td>
                <td>none</td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
                <td>tr</td>
                <td>table rows</td>
                <td>opening and closing tags with table headings & table data contained</td>
                <td>none</td>
            </tr>

                <td>none</td>
            </tr>
            <tr>

    <h2>Step 4</h2>
    <p>With your HTML code written, you can now star styling your webpage. This is the fun part. Be creative. Add colors, borders, align stuff, try some different fonts, and change the sizes of your elements. Most importantly, have fun!!!</p>
